# MEMORY ALLOCATION IN C
## Inspired by Tsoding [link](https://github.com/tsoding)

## Setup
```
make
./heap
```

## Limitations
- The pointers to the heap can only be located in the heap and the stack.
- No packed struct. All of the pointers should be aligned.
- No tricks that obscure the pointers (like zor linked list).
